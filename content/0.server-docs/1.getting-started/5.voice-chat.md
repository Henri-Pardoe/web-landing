# Voice Chat (VC)

Fat Duck Gaming requires all players to have a functioning microphone to be able to communicate with other people. The steps below will show how to set up voice chat. 

## Setting Up Voice Chat

1. Press `Escape` and go to settings.
2. Next go to the `Voice Chat` tab.
3. Make sure your Microphone Enabled is `On`.
4. Under `Input Device`, make sure you select the name of your Microphone and turn your Voice Chat Mode to `Push To Talk`.
5. To setup your Push To Talk bind go to `key binds > GTA Online > Push To Talk `

At any point you are struggling to set up your voice chat please put a `/report` in the game and contact a staff member to assist.
